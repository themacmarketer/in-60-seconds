d. 8 marks total (2 marks for each need statement and 2 marks for each piece of evidence)
* I need an easy way to find the information that I’m looking for. Evidence: Moving straight from the homepage to an FAQ (signalling they weren’t finding
the answers to their questions)
* I need important information up front before I spend more time reading. Evidence: Ranging from several years back to the present time, the maps helped Knight further understand where disengagement was happening, including discovering that only 25 percent of users would scroll on the homepage. OR Moving straight from the homepage to site search (usually searching for product queries, meaning they weren’t quickly getting the information they needed).

providers.
* Book phase: Offer travel insurance to customers

him/her. Offer him/her discounts at eateries in the airport

---

d. 5 marks (2 marks for identifying any lo-fidelity prototyping method and 1 mark for each reason):
* Pen on paper prototype
* A low fidelity method works better because the team is still in an initial phase of prototyping. The 2 marks can be awarded for any of the following reasons:

---
 
i. It’s fast. Every sketch should not take you more than a few minutes.
ii. Low cost. All it takes is 5 minutes of your time.
iii. Low attachment. It is less likely that you get attached to a prototype that you spent 5 minutes on.
iv. Obtaining honest feedback. Precisely because it isn’t very polished, your users have less issues criticizing it.

e. 8 marks (2 marks for each How Might We. You may award marks for any reasonable How Might We):

* How might Sarah enjoy the trip phase?
* How might we help Sarah to prepare earlier?
* How might we guide Sarah in preparing for her trip?
